# spidertrapserver
This java script is a basic implementation of a web server that serves random webpages with random links. The configuration section allows you to set parameters such as the number of links per page, the length of each link, the port to bind the web server, the delay between requests, and the characters used to compose random links.

Here's a brief explanation of the script:

The configuration section sets various parameters for generating random webpages and links, as well as the web server's port and delay.

The Handler class is derived from BaseHTTPRequestHandler to handle incoming requests.

The generate_page function generates a webpage with random links based on the provided seed.

The do_HEAD method sends the header information when a HEAD request is received.

The do_GET method responds to webpage requests with a page generated by the generate_page function. It introduces a delay (specified in the DELAY variable) to simulate server processing time.

#resolution to web spider:-

The main function reads a file (if provided as a command-line argument) containing a list of webpage names and sets the webpages attribute in the Handler class accordingly. If no file is provided, the server will generate random links instead.

The script then starts the HTTP server on the specified port and listens for incoming request
The Handler class is derived from BaseHTTPRequestHandler to handle incoming requests.

The webpages and page_count class variables are used to store the list of webpages and the page open count, respectively.

The generate_page method generates a webpage with random links based on the provided seed. It increments the page count for the specific seed (URL path) and checks if the page has been opened 100 times. If so, it prints the IP and MAC address of the client.

The get_client_mac method retrieves the client's MAC address based on its IP address using the 'arp' command on Linux/macOS systems.

The rest of the code remains unchanged from the previous version.With this implementation, the server will track the IP and MAC addresses of clients accessing a specific page (seed) when it is opened 100 times. It will print the details to the console when the condition is met.

As previously mentioned, please keep in mind that obtaining the MAC address of clients in a web server is subject to limitations and permissions in your network environment, and it may not be possible or appropriate in all scenarios. Additionally, the 'arp' command used in the get_client_mac method may not work on all systems, so you may need to adapt it based on your specific environment
